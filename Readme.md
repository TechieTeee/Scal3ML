# Scal3ML

## Background
Scal3ML is a decentralized machine learning platform built on blockchain technology. It enables users to collaborate, share data, and monetize machine learning models securely and transparently.

## Features
- **Data Sharing:** Easily share datasets with other users on the platform.
- **Model Sharing:** Collaborate with others by sharing machine learning models.
- **Monetization:** Monetize your data and models by offering them to other users.
- **Profit Sharing:** Distribute profits from data and model sales among collaborators.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Tools for collaboration on model development and improvement.

## Use Cases
- **Research Collaboration:** Researchers can collaborate on machine learning projects by sharing datasets and models.
- **Commercialization of Models:** Data scientists can monetize their models by offering them for sale to businesses and individuals.
- **Education:** Educators can use the platform to share educational datasets and models with students.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Smart Contracts:** Ethereum smart contracts are used to implement the platform's core functionality.
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** IPFS is used for decentralized storage of datasets and models.
- **Web3.js:** Web3.js is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain from the web application.
- **React.js:** The frontend of the application is built using React.js to provide a modern user interface.
- **Next.js:** Next.js is used for server-side rendering and routing in the React.js application.
- **Solidity:** Solidity is the programming language used for writing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Ethereum:** The platform is deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
- **Arbitrum:** The platform is deployed on the Arbitrum Stylus Testnet for testing and scalability evaluation.
- **Neon EVM:** The platform is deployed on the Neon EVM Testnet for testing and compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine.
